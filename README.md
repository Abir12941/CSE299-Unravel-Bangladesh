**Project Details**:

1.  **Idea** :  The idea was mainly to develop a tourism website for Bangladesh. The website works like a virtual tour-guide. People will be able to know about the travel details about their desired destinations. The details include - Descriptions, travel route, expense and overall logistics.

1.  **Goal** : The website is focused on being the first ever purely tourism-based website for Bangladesh. There is no specific website for a traveler to hit when it comes to tour in our country. Moreover, a foreigner may find it difficult to gain the necessary information about our country&#39;s tourism situation or travel logistics. So, we wanted the website to be the savior when it comes to make a tour in our country without any hassle or any complications.

1.  **Strategy** : The website has all the information about the most visited places in Bangladesh. A user can see every bit of details of their desired place including travel route, expenses, tour strategy, precautions, travel scheduling, ticket booking etc. Thus they don&#39;t need to search in anywhere else for any details before making the tour.


**Features & Details** :
1. Homepage --> At the very outset, the website welcomes the user with a nice and sooting homepage. From here the user will be able to navigate into the next pages.

![homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26319280/63650785-59e5ae80-c770-11e9-9eb3-0d70dbf7ec0d.PNG)

The homepage includes a Button called " Discover the Magic" which takes the user to the menu page afterwards. There is also a user id on top right and donate button on top left.

2. Menu --> After clicking on the "Discover The Magic" button the user will land on this page of the website. From here the user can select their desired destinations to see.

3. Feeds of most visited tourist sites in our country--> This is the core feature where tourists will be able to see the places of our country. At the divisional outset the user will get these views.

Here the reservation button on each card refers the user to the reservation feature page of the website.

5. Reservations-->With this feature users can book their preferable hotels in their desired destination. This falls under the reservation process feature. The base page houses the six divisional cards. These cards are a basic estimate and outlook of that particular division's hotel reservation processes.

6. Map --> A map is included in the website to enable the users to easily identify the location of our country. The map button is included in the footer section of the divisional pages and in the community page.

Here, the map includes six points on the divisions. By clicking each point the user will be able to see the basic tour places in that division.

7. Community of Users--> Here users can create and read posts about various tour places and share their tour experiences. The community button is included in the footer of the divisional pages.

The payment page includes a form where the user will be able to provide the details of them and the donation by Bkash or credit/debit cards. To pay with Bkash the user has to put in the TRXID into the form and submit with other information.

If the user wants to donate with card, there is also a button for this. The pay with card button is a STRIPE plugin which takes the donations and stores them into the admin dashboard of Stripe for that particular admin account.

**Business Plan:**

Although the project is solely a non-profitable effort towards the representation of our country, still there are some revenue generating process in it.

There will be booking (hotels) system through the website which will allow the flow of revenue through the website. However, we, the developers will be taking only 10% of the cost of the booking going through our website.

We will be offering parnership with booking sites to make booking deals via our website. Thus it will help us earn per booking through Unravel Bangladesh.

The donation money will be used to help the  underpreviledged people and only 10% of it will be used for further development of the website.

**Payment Methods** :

We will be using Bkash, Credit/Debit Cards as our basic payment methods for any kind of transactions. We used "Stripe checkout" system to manage the transaction done with cards.

**Future Extension:**

There are plenty of room for improvement. The website may be modified and enhanced into something more beautiful and user-friendly over time.
