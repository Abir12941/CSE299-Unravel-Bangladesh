**Project Details**:

1.  **Idea** :  The idea is mainly to develop a tourism website for Bangladesh. The website will work like a virtual tour-guide. People will be able to know about the travel details about their desired destinations. The details include - Descriptions, travel route, expense and overall logistics.

1.  **Goal** : The website is focused on being the first ever purely tourism-based website for Bangladesh. There is no specific website for a traveler to hit when it comes to tour in our country. Moreover, a foreigner may find it difficult to gain the necessary information about our country&#39;s tourism situation or travel logistics. So, we want the website to be the savior when it comes to make a tour in our country without any hassle or any complications.

1.  **Strategy** : The website will have all the information about the most visited places in Bangladesh. A user can see every bit of details of their desired place including travel route, expenses, tour strategy, precautions, travel scheduling, ticket booking etc. Thus they don&#39;t need to search in anywhere else for any details before making the tour.


**Features** :

1. 1)Feeds of most visited tourist sites in our country.
2. 2)Community of Users
3. 3)Ticket Booking
4. 4)Travel Scheduling
5. 5)Reviews
6. 6)Admin-control
7. 7)User Signup/Sign-in

**Technology** :

1. Back-End:
  1. Django-framework
  2. Python
  3. Sqlite3
2. Front-End:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS/SASS/BOOTSTRAP
  3. JavaScript
3. Deployment:  Local (initially)
4. IDE: Pycharm

**Business Plan:**

Although the project is solely a non-profitable effort towards the representation of our country, still there are some revenue generating process in it.

There will be booking (ticket/hotels) system through the website which will allow the flow of revenue through the website. However, we, the developers will not be taking any part of it.

**Payment Methods** :

We will be using Bkash, Credit/Debit Cards as our basic payment methods for any kind of transactions.

**N.B** : Final outcome may include some more features or design upgrade.
