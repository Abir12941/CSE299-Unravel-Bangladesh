**Project Details**:

1.  **Idea** :  The idea was mainly to develop a tourism website for Bangladesh. The website works like a virtual tour-guide. People will be able to know about the travel details about their desired destinations. The details include - Descriptions, travel route, expense and overall logistics.

1.  **Goal** : The website is focused on being the first ever purely tourism-based website for Bangladesh. There is no specific website for a traveler to hit when it comes to tour in our country. Moreover, a foreigner may find it difficult to gain the necessary information about our country&#39;s tourism situation or travel logistics. So, we wanted the website to be the savior when it comes to make a tour in our country without any hassle or any complications.

1.  **Strategy** : The website has all the information about the most visited places in Bangladesh. A user can see every bit of details of their desired place including travel route, expenses, tour strategy, precautions, travel scheduling, ticket booking etc. Thus they don&#39;t need to search in anywhere else for any details before making the tour.


**Features & Details** :
1. Homepage --> At the very outset, the website welcomes the user with a nice and sooting homepage. From here the user will be able to navigate into the next pages.

The homepage includes a Button called " Discover the Magic" which takes the user to the menu page afterwards. There is also a user id on top right and donate button on top left.
2. Feeds of most visited tourist sites in our country--> This is the core feature where tourists will be able to see the details and logistics. This is the divisional pages of the website.
3. Community of Users--> Here users can create and read posts about various tour places and share their tour experiences.
4. Booking-->With this feature users can book their preferable hotels in their desired destination. This falls under the reservation process feature.
5. Map --> A map is included in the website to enable the users to easily identify the location of our country.
6. Donations - User will be able to make donations through our website. The donations will be then given to provide healthcare to the people living below the poverty line.
7. Admin-control--> The primary admin has all the access but he/she can assign other users based on their contributions to the community, as moderator or core panel admin too.
8. User Signup/Sign-in-->There is a sign in/sign up feature to authenticate users before  posting in the community.

**Technology** :

1. Back-End:
  * Django-framework
  * Python
  * Sqlite3
2. Front-End:
  * HTML
  * CSS/SASS/BOOTSTRAP
  * JavaScript
3. Deployment:  Local (initially)
4. IDE: Pycharm
5. Github Desktop

**Business Plan:**

Although the project is solely a non-profitable effort towards the representation of our country, still there are some revenue generating process in it.

There will be booking (hotels) system through the website which will allow the flow of revenue through the website. However, we, the developers will be taking only 10% of the cost of the booking going through our website.

We will be offering parnership with booking sites to make booking deals via our website. Thus it will help us earn per booking through Unravel Bangladesh.

**Payment Methods** :

We will be using Bkash, Credit/Debit Cards as our basic payment methods for any kind of transactions. We used "Stripe checkout" system to manage the transaction done with cards.
